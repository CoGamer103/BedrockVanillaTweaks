# Updates on Vanilla Tweaks in Minecraft Bedrock
On this Page we want to update you on the progress(when new things come out) and the current status(what is plannded).
## Who are *we*?
We are lithium-lx(behavior packs) and alt03b1(resource packs) and we have the dream of porting everything of vanilla tweaks project to the bedrock edition. We work on that in our spare time, so dont be dissapointed if we don't add new things to this project regularly.
## Things that are going to be added in the near future
### Crafting tweaks
We are working on that pretty hard, expect it to be (nearly)fully ported in the next week, but some things aren't possible jet with the current bedrock engine.
## Things that we are planning to add, but they might get discarded
### Website
We definetly want a website similar to the vanilla tweaks one, but we are both not the best at developing web pages, so a module picker that adds all options into one package takes a while
